# Code generation

There is an experimental code generation tool available for TypedRest. This tool automatically infers [TypedRest Endpoints](../endpoints/index.md) from patterns in [OpenAPI/Swagger](https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/) documents and generates source code for TypedRest clients. It currently only supports generating C# clients.

Take a look at the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TypedRest/CodeGeneration/).
